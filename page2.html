            These studies would today be considered under field of ecology but in former times, 
            such research was undertaken mainly by amateurs, 
            often physicians, civil servants and army officers.

            Although the growth of modern natural history in India can be attributed to
             British colonialism and the growth of natural history in Britain, there is considerable 
             evidence to suggest that India with its diverse landscapes, fauna and flora along with other 
             tropical colonies helped in creating an increased interest in natural history in Britain and 
             elsewhere in the world.[1] Natural history in India was also enriched by older traditions of 
             conservation, folklore, nature study and the arts.
